# Project Goals
Investagate to see if there are relevant information to determine if animals are endangered.

# Data
Observations data on one side
Species data on the other side

# Analysis
Explore the different data available for the discovery
Analyze each dataset separately
Eliminate what could biais the data like outliers or null value and see how to handle it (deletions/averages/value before or after...etc...)
Combine dataset on common columns to project new insight on the data

# Evaluation
See results from initial discovery
See how to combine both table data with relevancy for an optimal data analysis (quality & high relevance)

# Output
A variety of visual representation of the data, sometimes the same columns to see have a full vision in how relations are potentially existing.
Intermediate conclusion to give direction and a road to the final conclusion in the form of text.
Powerpoint presentation with text and visual representations of certain relevant graphs.
Last statement responding to the project goal.
